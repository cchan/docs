Welcome to Read The Docs
========================

`Read the Docs`_ hosts documentation for the open source community.
We support Sphinx_ docs written with reStructuredText_ and `CommonMark`_.
We pull your code from your Subversion_, Bazaar_, Git_, and Mercurial_ repositories.
Then we build documentation and host it for you.
Think of it as *Continuous Documentation*.

The code is open source, and `available on GitHub`_.
